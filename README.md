# Housing-in-Mexico
In this project, I worked with a dataset with 21,000 properties for sale in Mexico through the real estate website Properati.com. The goal was to determine whether sale prices are influenced more by property size or location.
Some of the things I did in this project are:

-Organized information using basic Python data structures.

-Imported data from CSV files and cleaned it using the pandas library.

-Created data visualizations like scatter and box plots.

-Examined the relationship between two variables using correlation.
