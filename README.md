# Housing-in-Brasil
In this project, I worked with a dataset of homes for sale in Brasil. The goal was to determine if there are regional differences in the real estate market. Also,I looked at southern Brazil to see if there is a relationship between home size and price. 

Some of the things I did in this project are:

-Organized information using basic Python data structures.

-Imported data from CSV files and cleaned it using the pandas library.

-Created data visualizations like scatter and box plots.

-Examined the relationship between two variables using correlation.
